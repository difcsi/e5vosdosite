# API Endpoint Proposal Template

## Summary

Include a short summary of the proposal here. Describe where the endpoint will be used, what it will do, and why it is needed.

This is to allow development before endpoint details are finalized. Frontend developers are expected to submit a proposal for requested endpoints, whilst backend developers are expected to submit a proposal for endpoints they are working on: so that frontend can start working immediately.

## Endpoint Details

Always include the full endpoint, and any diffs.

```diff
[...]
responses:
    "200":
        [...]
+    "201":
+       description: Event created
+       content:
+           application/json:
+               schema:
+                   $ref: "#/components/schemas/Event"
[...]
```

```yaml
/events/:
    description: Returns all events

                            items:
                                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Event'
    post:

        responses:

                description: Event created
                content:
                    application/json:
                        schema:
                            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Event'
        security:
            - e5vosdo_auth:
                  - write:events

## Model Modifications

```

```yaml

    properties:
        id:
